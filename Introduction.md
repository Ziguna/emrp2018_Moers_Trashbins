 **Introduction**
Waste is one of the burden issues throughout the world and to some extent that poses a negative impact on human health. The management of waste is a challenging task to carry out which consists of collection, transport, treatment, and proper disposal. 
On this project, our main concern is the proper collection of the waste with less effort and time. Waste collection considers with type and size of bins, the position of the bins in such needed location, and how often bins are to be serviced. Overfilled bins result in waste falling out which reflect the unmanaged structure and some may contain hazardous materials that have adverse effects on the environment.

With the integration with [ ENNI ](https://www.enni.de/)  who takes responsibility for the waste management of the Moers city. For the concern on a collection of waste around 11000 waste bins are situated through the Moers city. And there is a lot of effort and time consuming to collect the waste.
